## Printing on Linux

printing itself requires software that converts information from application you are using to a language your printer can understand.  

The Linux standard for printing software is the Common UNIX Printing System (`CUPS`)

Modern Linux desktop systems make installing and administering printers simple and intuitive.  
Nevertheless, it is instructive to understand the underpinnings of how it is done in Linux.   


## CUPS Overview

`CUPS` interprets page descriptions produced by your application (put a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth) and then sends the information to the printer. it acts as a print server for both local and network printers.

Printers manufactured by different companies may use thire own particular print lnagues and formats. CUPS uses a modular printing system that accommodates a wide variety printers and also processes various data formats.
