## wget

- Large file downloads
- Recursive downloads, where a web page refers to other web pages and all are downloaded at once
- Password-required downloads
- Multiple file downloads

## curl

Besides downloading, you may want to obtain information about a URL, such as the source code being used. `curl` can be used from the command line or a script to read such information.
