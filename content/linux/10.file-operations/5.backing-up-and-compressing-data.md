## 1. Backing Up Data

cp <-> rsync

1. rsync is more efficient, because it checks if the file being copied already exists.
2. rsync copies only the parts of files that have actually changed, it can be very fast
3. cp can only copy files to and from destinations on the local machine (unless mounted using NFS), rsync can also be used to copy files from one machine to another.
   - someone@host:path

## 2. Using rsync

a very useful way to back up a project directory might be to use the following command.

```bash
rsync -r project-X archive-machine:archives/project-X
```

## 3. Compressing Data

| command | usage                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gzip    |                                                                                   |
| bzip2   | produces files significantly smaller than those produced by gzip                  |
| xz      | the most space-efficient compression utility used in Linux                        |
| zip     | is often required to examine and decompress archives from other operating systems |

tar utility is often used to group files in an archive and then compress the whole archive at once. 

```bash
tar Jczf mydir.tar.xz mydir
tar xvf mydir.tar.xz 
```

## 10. Disk-to-Disk Copying (dd)

first 512 byte sector on the disk that contains a table describing the partitions on that disk.

```bash
dd if=/dev/sda of=sda.mbr bs=512 count=1
```
