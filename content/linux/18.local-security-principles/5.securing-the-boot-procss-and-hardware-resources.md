## Requiring Boot Loader Passwords 

You can secure the boot process with a secure epassword to prevent someone from bypassing the user authentication step. This can work in conjunction with password protection for the BIOS. Note that while using a bootloader passwrd laone will stop a user from editing the bootloader configuration during the boot process, it will `not` prevent a user from booting from and alterantive boot media such as optical disks or pen drives. Thus, it should be used with a BIOS password for a full protection.  

GRUB 2 version, things became more complicated to set a password. However, can take advantage of more advanced features, such as user-specific passwords. 

You never edit `grub.cfg` directly; instead, modify the configuration files in `/etc/grub.d` and `etc/default/grub` and then run `update-grub` or `grub2-mkconfig` and same the new configuration file.
