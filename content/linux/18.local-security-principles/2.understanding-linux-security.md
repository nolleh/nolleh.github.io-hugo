## User Accounts

Linux kernel authenticated users to access files and applications.  
while each user is identified by a unique integer (the user id or UID), a separate database associates a username with each UID.

## Types of Accounts

By default, Linux distinguishes between several account types in order to isolate processes and workloads.  
Linux has fourtypes of accounts:

- root
- System
- Normal
- Network

For a safe working env, it is advised to grant minimum privileges possible and necessary to accounts, and remove inactive accounts.  
The `last` utiltiy, which shows the last time each user logged into the system, can be used to help identify potentially inactive accounts which are candidates for system removal.
