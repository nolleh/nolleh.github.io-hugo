## How Passwords Are Stored 

The system verifies authenticity and identity using user credentials.  

Originally, encrypted passwords wer stored in the `/etc/passwd` file, which was readable by everyone. this mde it rather easy for passwords to be craked.  

On modern systems. passwords are actually stored in an encrypted format in a secondary file named `etc/shadow` Onyly those with root access can read or modify this file.  


## Password Encrpytion 

Protecting passwords has became a curucial element of security. Most Linux distributions rely on a modern password encryption algorithm called SHA-512 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 512 bits), developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to encrypt passwords.   

The SHA-512 algorithm is widely used for security applications and protocols. These security applications and protocols include TLS, SSL, PHP, SSH, S/MIME and IPSec. SHA-512 is one of  the most tested hashing algorithms.

for example, if you wish to experiment with SHA-512 encoding, the word "test" can be encoded using the program `sha512sum` to produce the SHA-12 form

## Good Password Practices   

- password aging 
by `chage`

- users to set strong passwords 
by Pluggable Authentication Modules 
PAM configuration is implemented using a library called `pam_cracklib.so`, which can also be replaced by `pam_passwdqc.so` to take advantage of more options.
