## tr

the `tr` utility is used to translate specified characters into other characters or to delete them.

```bash
tr [options] set1 [set2]
```

set1: to be replaced or removed
set2: to be substituted for the characters listed in the first argument.

tr '{}' '()' < inputfile > outputfile

- translate braces into parenthesis

echo " ... " | tr [:space:] '\t'

- translate white-space to tabs

echo "This is for testing" | tr -s [:space:]

- squeeze repetition of characters using -s

echo "the geek stuff" | tr -d 't'

- delete specified characters using -d option

echo "my username is 432234" | tr -cd [:digit:]

- complement the sets using -c option

tr -cd [:print:] < file.txt

- remove all non-printable character from a file

tr -s '\n' ' ' < file.txt

- join all the lines in a file into a single file

## tee

tee takes the output from any command, and, while sending it to standard output, it also saves it to a file. in other words, it tees the output stream from the command: one stream is displayed on the standard output and the other is saved to a file.

## wc

wc -l: line
wc -c: bytes
wc -w: words

## cut

cut -d" " -f3
