## sort

sort -k 3 <filename>

- sort the lines by the 3rd field on each line instead of the beginning

sort -u <filename>
equivalent to run uniq after sort

## uniq

uniq removes duplicate consecutive lines in a text file and is useful for simplifying the text display
uniq requires that the duplicate entries must be consecutive, one often runs sort first and then pipes the output into uniq;

to count the number of duplicate entries, use the following command:

uniq -c filename

## paste

the different columns are identified based on delimiters (spacing used to separated two fields).

paste accepts the following options:

- d delimiters, which specify a list of delimiters to be used instead of tabs for separating consecutive values on a single line.  
  Each delimiter is used in turn;
  when the list has been exhuasted, paste begins again at the first delimiters
  -s, which causes paste to append the data in series rather than in parallel; that is, in a horizon rather than vertical fashion.

## join

can be used to combine the files without repeating the data of common columns.  
it first checks whether the files share common fields, such as names or phone numbers, and then joins the lines in two files based on a common field.

## split

split is sued to break up (or split) a file into equal-sized segments for easier viewing and mnipulation, and is generally used only on relatively large files.

## regular expressions and search patterns

| pattern | usage                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| .       | any single char                |
| a\|z    | a or z                         |
| $       | end of a line                  |
| ^       | beginning of a line            |
| \*      | preceding item 0 or more times |
