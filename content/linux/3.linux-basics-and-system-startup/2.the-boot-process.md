The Linux boot process is the procedure for initializing the system.  
from when the computer power is first swithced on until the user interface is fully operational.

having a good understanding of the steps in the boot process may help you with troubleshooting problems, as well as with tailoring the computer's performance to your needs.

On the other hand, the boot process can be rather technical, and you can start using Linux without knowing all the details.

**NOTE: You may want to come back and study this section later, if you want to first get a good feel for how to use a Linux system.**


## BIOS - The First Step 

starting an x86-based Linux system involves a number of stps.   
the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware, including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory.  
This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).

The BIOS software is stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard, After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system (OS).
