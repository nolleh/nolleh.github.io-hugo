# 3-4. Linux FileSystem Basics

## Linux FileSystem

- Conventional disk filesystems: ext3, ext4, XFS, Btrfs, JFS, NTFS, vfat, exfat, etc.
- Flash storage filesystems: ubifs, jffs2, yaffs, etc.
- Database filesystems
- Special purpose filesystems: procfs, sysfs, tmpfs, squashfs, debugfs, fuse, etc.

## Partitions and Filesystems

A **partition** is physically contiguous section of disk, or what appears to be so in some advanced setups.

A **filesystem** is a method of storing/finding files on the hard disk (usually in a partition).

One can think of a partition as a container in which a filesystem resides, although in some circumstances,  
a filesystem can span more than one partition if one uses symbolic links, which we will discuss much later.

A comparison between filesystems in Windows and Linux is given in the accompanying table:

|                                  | Windows     | Linux                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Partition                        | Disk1       | /dev/sda1              |
| Filesystem Type                  | NTFS/VFAT   | EXT3/EXT4/XFS/BTRFS... |
| Mounting Parmeters               | DriveLetter | MountPoint             |
| Base Folder (where OS is stored) | C:\         | /                      |

## The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

Linux system store their important files according to a standard layout called the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard ([FHS](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.pdf)),
Having a starndard is designed to ensure that users, administrators, and developers can move between distributions without having to re-learn how the system is organized.

## More About the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

All linux filesystem names are case-sensative.
