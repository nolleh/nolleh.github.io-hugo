# Graphical Desktop  


## Graphical Desktop

CLI or GUI.  

GUI is quick and easy.  

for repeated tasks, the CLI is often more efficient, while the GUI is easier to navigate if you do not remember all the details or do something only rarely.  


## X Window System

X window system is loaded as one of the final steps in boot process. It is often just called X.  

A service called the **Display Manager** keeps track of displays being provided and loads the X server (so-called, because it provides graphical services to applications, sometimes called X clients.)  

the display manager also handles graphical logins and starts the appropriate desktop environment after a user logs in.  

X is rather old software;
A newer system, known as [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), is gradually supersending it and is the default display system in Fedora, RHEL 8, and other recent distributions. For the most part, it looks just like X to the user, although under hood it is quite different.
